# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in C/C++

A comprehensive collection of **data structures**, **search/sort algorithms**, and advanced **memory-safe programming techniques** implemented in **C++**, **C**, and **Python**.

This repository is ideal for students, interview preparation, competitive programming, or anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of low-level algorithmic thinking.

## 🧠 Extra_Smart_Solutions - Advanced Memory Safety (C++)

This folder is dedicated to **enhancing C/C++ memory safety**, especially in performance-critical or low-level systems programming scenarios.

| File Name             | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Memory_Pooling.cpp`  | Efficient dynamic memory reuse to reduce fragmentation and allocations. |
| `Smart_Pointers.cpp`  | Demonstration of unique/shared pointer behavior and usage.              |
| `Poisoned_Pointer.cpp`| Simulates poisoned pointers to catch use-after-free bugs.               |

> ✅ These implementations focus on **preventing memory leaks, dangling pointers, and use-after-free vulnerabilities** in C/C++ environments.
